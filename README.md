# NYBestseller
Group Project | New York Times Bestseller List

This is a student group project of the University of St.Gallen within the scope of the course “Programming with Advanced Computer Languages”. This Python Project is based on a comprehensive list of New York Times (NYT) bestseller books (fiction & non-fiction) since the year 1942. It aims to design, implement and test a program that allows a user to search for a subset of bestseller books which have appeared in the NYT bestseller lists. To do so, he / she can choose inquiries from a list of search requests, insert individual search requests and, thereby, receive a personalized list of book based on the input parameters.

*Prerequisites:*
The program at hand works in / with Python3. ##?

*Further Instructions:*
In order to run the code, please first download both, the file that contains our python code “main.py” as well as the .txt file with the underlying data to successfully run the program. Next, please upload both files to a Python platform of your choice, such as Repl.it, where the main code can be pasted onto a new file and the .txt file uploaded in the same folder such that the code can draw information from the dataset. Once both files are uploaded, the code can be runned and the first console asking the user to enter input appears.

*Files:*
Code: /main.py
Input dataset in txt: /bestsellers.txt
