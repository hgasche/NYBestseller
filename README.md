# NYBestseller
Python Group Project | New York Times Bestseller List

**About:**

This is a student group project of the University of St. Gallen within the scope of the course “Programming with Advanced Computer Languages”. 
This Python Project is based on a comprehensive list of New York Times (NYT) bestseller books (fiction & non-fiction) since the year 1942. It aims to design, implement, and test a program that allows a user to search for a subset of bestseller books which have appeared in the NYT bestseller lists. To do so, the user can choose inquiries from a list of search requests, insert individual search requests and, thereby, receive a personalized list of books based on the input parameters. The user can search the books by the following menu options:

1. Display all books in a year range
2. Display all books in a specific month and year
3. Search for an author
4. Search for a title
Q. The program quits the search query
The program will continue to execute until the user selects “Q” (or “q”) as the menu option.



**Prerequisites:**

The program at hand works with Python3. In order to run it, no additional libraries need to be installed.



**Instructions:**
1. Start main.py
2. You may add the txt file bestsellers.txt, which can be downloaded above, to the folder
In order to run the code, please first download both, the file that contains our python code “main.py” as well as the .txt file with the underlying data to successfully run the program. Next, please upload both files to a Python platform of your choice, such as Repl.it, where the main code can be pasted onto a new file and the .txt file uploaded in the same folder such that the code can draw information from the dataset. Once both files are uploaded, the code can be run and the first console asking the user to enter input appears.



**Files:**

Code: /main.py
Input dataset in txt: /bestsellers.txt



**Further Description:**

Take care: Words in both, the book titles as well as the names of the authors are not separated in the bestellers.txt file and will, hence, also not be separated in the output.
