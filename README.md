# NYBestseller
Group Project | New York Times Bestseller List

This is a student group project of the University of St.Gallen within the scope of the course “Programming with Advanced Computer Languages”. This Python Project is based on a comprehensive list of New York Times (NYT) bestseller books (fiction & non-fiction) since the year 1942. It aims to design, implement and test a program that allows a user to search for a subset of bestseller books which have appeared in the NYT bestseller lists. To do so, he / she can choose inquiries from a list of search requests, insert individual search requests and, thereby, receive a personalized list of book based on the input parameters.
